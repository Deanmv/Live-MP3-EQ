Live MP3 EQ
==============

About
-----
This project was created as part of University and is a [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.sourceforge.net) project that allows the user to load the an MP3 file (using quarks) and then live EQ the file as it plays.  Instructions for installing are included when it is evaluated within SuperCollider

Controls
--------

After the song starts playing and the frequency analyser starts displays the file then using the mouse controls the effect of the EQ on the sound file.  Left to right affects the frequency (absolute left being 0hz and absolute right being 15000hz) and top to bottom controls the gain (absolute top being +12dB and absolute bottom being -60dB)

Bugs
----

Currently there is one bug where if the song finishes then the user will have to click the play button twice to start it again.
